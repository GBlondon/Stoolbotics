#Closing Remarks

##Future Improvements


There is one future improvement that I can think of that could be made the simulator:

A user scripting environment would have been nice. This could allow people to write scripts that do things like inverse kinematics, workspace calculations, finding DH parameters, etc. The simulator would have to be modified to include hooks to look for scripts. In the case of inverse kinematics, a hook would need to look for a function and pass it forward kinematics information and expect to get a list of joint angles in return.
